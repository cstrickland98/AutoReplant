# AutoReplant
Hey everyone! This is a plugin I decided to make because I couldn't find any up to date ones online. This plugin automatically replants wheat, potatoes, carrots, beetroots, and netherwart.

# Commands
/ARDebugToggle - Toggles debugging to the console. This was mostly useful for me, but it sends to the console:

The number of items taken from the inventory
The inventory location
The player they were taken from
Defaults to false in the config, but it was useful in testing to make sure the right amount of materials was being taken out of my inventory.

/ARFullGrowToggle - Toggles the fully grown crop requirement.

/ARToggle - Toggles autoreplanting

# Permissions
autoreplant.debug.toggle - Allows the permission holder to toggle console debugging. Defaults to op.
autoreplant.replant - Allows the permission holder to have their crops automatically replanted for them. Defaults to op.
autoreplant.fullygrown.toggle - Allows you to turn the fully grown requirements on/off. Defaults to op.
autoreplant.toggle - Allows you to toggle replanting on/off. Defaults to op.
# TODO
Any requests.
Feel free to give me tips, advice, and criticism so I can become a better programmer!
